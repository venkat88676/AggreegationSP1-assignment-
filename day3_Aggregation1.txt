0.Create a sample dataset in a MongoDB collection that contains the following documents:
=>
db.day3.insertMany([{
   _id: 1,
   name: "John",
   age: 25,
   address: "123 Main St"
},
{
   _id: 2,
   name: "Jane",
   age: 35,
   address: "456 Main St"
},
{
   _id: 3,
   name: "Bob",
   age: 45,
   address: "789 Main St"
},
{
   _id: 4,
   name: "Alice",
   age: 55,
   address: "246 Main St"
}])




1.Create a separate collection that contains information about the zip codes for each address. The structure of the documents in this collection should be as follows:-
=> db.day3.aggregate([{$lookup:{from:"customers",localField:"name",foreignField:"name",as:"location"}},{$set:{zipcode:{$arrayElemAt:["$location.address.zip",0]}}},{$project:{address:1,zipcode:1}},{$out:"day31"}])



2.Create a third collection that contains information about the city and state for each zip code. The structure of the documents in this collection should be as follows:
=>
db.day3.aggregate([{$lookup:{from:"customers",localField:"name",foreignField:"name",as:"location"}},{$set:{zipcode:{$arrayElemAt:["$location.address.zip",0]},city:{$arrayElemAt:["$location.address.city",0]},state:{$arrayElemAt:["$location.address.state",0]}}},{$project:{zipcode:1,city:1,state:1}},{$out:"day32"}])

3.Create a fourth collection that contains information about the country for each state. The structure of the documents in this collection should be as follows:
=>
db.day3.aggregate([{$lookup:{from:"customers",localField:"name",foreignField:"name",as:"location"}},{$set:{state:{$arrayElemAt:["$location.address.state",0]},country:{$arrayElemAt:["$location.address.country",0]}}},{$project:{state:1,country:1}},{$out:"day33"}])
